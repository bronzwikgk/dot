const dataset_constraints = [
  "Browser storage must respect same-origin policies, quota limits, and never hold unencrypted-sensitive data.",
  "Google Apps Script flows obey execution-time quotas, API rate limits, and required OAuth scopes.",
  "Node.js deployments cannot rely on IndexedDB or DOM access and must guard filesystem concurrency (lock directories).",
  "actionLoader only consumes .js configs (plus supported formats) and must protect against circular recursion and untrusted imports.",
  "Plugins must avoid blocking loops, honor isolation boundaries, and expose hook cleanup so monitors stay responsive.",
  "HTTP and external APIs enforce rate limits, circuit breakers, OAuth refresh, and webhook signature verification.",
  "Storage drivers must support encryption-at-rest, backups, and fallback strategies when a backend becomes unavailable.",
  "Event/view updates only run in runtimes with DOM access; fallback data-only flows must exist elsewhere.",
  "Release phases (core, integration, financial, productivity, AI) gate a dataset’s readiness and determine which tools are allowed per stage.",
