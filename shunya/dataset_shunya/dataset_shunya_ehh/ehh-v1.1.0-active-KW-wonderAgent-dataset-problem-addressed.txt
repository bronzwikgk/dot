const dataset_problem_addressed = [
  "Developers and writers lose time because the actionApp, actionEntity, and deepseek docs live in separate locations.",
  "QA and integrators face inconsistent runtime handling between browser, Node.js, Apps Script, Deno, and Bun.",
  "Product teams cannot trust UX updates since no event/view binding reliably communicates with the actionEngine.",
  "Ops and platform engineers duplicate efforts because config, HTTP, and storage helpers are scattered and inconsistent.",
  "Plugin authors find the hook sequences vague, making extensibility fragile or error-prone.",
  "New contributors lack a single dataset to explore each concern, slowing onboarding and experimentation.",
