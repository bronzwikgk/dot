const dataset_requirement = [
  "Support multi-format configs (.js, .json, .yaml, .csv, .xml, .html, .jsonl).",
  "Ensure actionEvent can route DOM triggers to actionEngine descriptors securely.",
  "Provide pluggable storage adapters (ActionFs, IndexedDBStorage, LocalStorageAdapter, ActionSpreadsheetAdapter).",
  "Expose httpService capabilities like OAuth, webhook signing, and retries.",
  "Deliver monitoring/health data through logger and monitor components.",
  "Offer a dataset in each file for every conceptual topic in the spec.",
  "Follow the design spec constraints: ES6 imports only, traditional for loops, function syntax, explicit properties, and request-response transactions.",
  "Keep configs in .js modules while also supporting YAML, JSON, CSV, XML, HTML, and JSONL formats mentioned in the requirements tree.",
  "Triple runtime support (Node.js, Browser, Apps Script, Deno, Bun) with priority P0 core framework coverage.",
  "Configuration system must only use ES6 imports, avoid forEach/arrow/shorthand, keep globals defined externally, and drive behavior through exported .js configs.",
  "Plugin system requirements include lifecycle management, dependencies, hook execution, isolation, and error handling hooks.",
  "External API service needs HTTP clients per runtime, API registration, circuit breakers, rate limiting, retries/backoffs, OAuth2, API keys, and webhook support.",
  "Entity and record management enforce schema validation, relationships, inheritance, metadata tracking, and fallback storage drivers.",
  "Storage backends must provide memory, file, SQL, NoSQL, browser, and Apps Script options with encryption, migration, sync, fallback, and monitoring.",
  "Financial, product lifecycle, and integration services layers require dedicated support for portfolios, watchlists, brokers, project/task/customer data, and payment providers.",
  "Action system demands CRUD plus search/filter/sort/pagination operations, coupled with ActionValidator, ActionFs, and ActionServer behavior.",
  "Security and access control insist on authentication, RBAC, CORS, data security, encryption, and auditing safeguards.",
  "Utility requirements cover HTTP, data, file, and template helpers along with multi-format parsing and caching.",
  "Monitoring/logging requirements include health checks, metrics, error tracking, usage analytics, dashboards, alerts, and audit logging.",
  "Development tooling must offer unit/integration/performance/security testing, mock services, debugging tools, and documentation assets.",
  "Performance specs expect caching, optimization, and scalability strategies to keep operations responsive.",
  "UI/UX expectations call for admin interfaces, data viz, dynamic forms, report exports, and accessibility support.",
