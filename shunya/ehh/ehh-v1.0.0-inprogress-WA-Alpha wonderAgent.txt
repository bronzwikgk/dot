## Purpose
Summarize the project assets, configuration, core modules, documentation, plugins, utilities, and coverage expectations so new contributors can orient themselves immediately.

## Assets
- `logos`: iconography and brand assets referenced by documentation or UI scaffolds.

## Configuration
### Global Configurations
- `appConfig`: application-wide flags, build profiles, and feature toggles.
- `entityCollectionConfig`: metadata describing each entity collection, field relationships, and indexing strategy.
- `entityConfig`: per-entity schema descriptors, validation rules, and lifecycle hooks.
- `routeConfig`: route definitions, guards, and handler mapping for server/client layers.
- `globalRuleConfig`: business rules applied across the stack including access, retention, and scheduling.
- `listenerConfig`: list of event listeners and their trigger contexts.
- `viewConfig`: layout presets, view parameters, and feature gating.
- `serviceConfig`: backend service bindings, retries, and circuit-breaker behavior.
- `pluginConfig`: declarations for plugin lifecycle, dependencies, and initialization order.
- `utilityConfig`: reusable helpers, defaults, and shared constants that drive other configs.

## Core
- `Entry.js`: bootstraps the application with configuration, wires central services, and exposes primary lifecycle hooks.
- `ActionApp.js`: orchestrates actions, handles context switching, and integrates plugin payloads.

## Documentation
- `User docs`: end-user guidance and workflows.
- `Developer docs`: integration guides, coding patterns, and contribution notes.
- `About`: overview of the platform mission, team, and governance.
- `API`: surface area of available APIs including contracts, authentication, and error handling.

## Plugins
- `ActionEntity`: entity lifecycle helpers.
- `ActionView`: rendering adapters and view utilities.
- `ActionEvent`: domain event processing.
- `ActionServer`: server-side middleware and routing helpers.
- `ActionClient`: client synchronization, websockets, and polling strategies.
- `ActionEngine Flow`: workflow definitions and state machine transitions.

## Utility
- `ActionValidator`: centralized validation rules and schema enforcement helpers.
- `ActionInclude`: shared includes leveraged by other actions.
- `Parser`: document or payload parsing utilities.
- `Include`: generic include helpers for templates or code generation.
- `ActionTree`: tree walkers used by batch operations or reports.
- `ActionFs`: filesystem helpers for asset management or caching layers.
- `ActionIndexDb`: indexedDB helpers for client persistence.
- `ActionLocalStorage`: localStorage bindings and cache eviction strategies.
- `HttpService`: HTTP client wrappers with retry and timeout handling.
- `ActionAgent`: worker/agent orchestration utilities.
- `Mat`: matrix or math helpers for analytics flows.
- `ActionOllama`: Ollama integrations and model connectors.
- `Watchman`: file or process monitoring helpers.

## Test Cases
- Outline scenarios that validate critical flows, configuration permutations, and plugin integrations.

## Use Cases
- `erms`: enterprise resource management flows and reconciliation.
- `TMS`: transportation management sequences and scheduling.
- `ActionSpace`: workspace orchestration, layout, and collaboration.
- `ActionAgent`: runtime agent coordination.
- `Mat`: analytical use cases and simulation tooling.
