# ehh Manifest Reference
Version: 1.0.1
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Purpose
Establish a structured manifest that makes assets, configuration layers, core services, docs, source modules, and operational artifacts discoverable for the `ehh` workspace.

## Assets
- `logos`: iconography, branding, and illustration assets referenced in documentation or UI layouts.

## Configuration
### Global Configurations
- `appConfig`: application-wide runtime flags, build profiles, and feature toggles.
- `entityCollectionConfig`: metadata describing each entity collection, relational mappings, and indexing strategy.
- `entityConfig`: per-entity schema descriptors, validation rules, and lifecycle hooks.
- `routeConfig`: route definitions, guards, middleware associations, and handler mapping for server/client surfaces.
- `globalRuleConfig`: business rules applied across the stack, including compliance, retention, and scheduling policies.
- `listenerConfig`: catalog of event listeners and their trigger contexts.
- `viewConfig`: layout presets, view parameters, and feature gating nuggets.
- `serviceConfig`: backend service bindings, retries, and circuit-breaker behavior.
- `pluginConfig`: plugin lifecycle declarations, dependencies, and initialization order.
- `utilityConfig`: reusable helpers, defaults, and shared constants that other areas consume.

## Core
- `Entry.js`: bootstraps the platform, wires central services (routing, persistence, logging), and exposes the primary lifecycle hooks.
- `ActionApp.js`: orchestrates actions, handles intent/context switching, integrates plugin payloads, and surfaces telemetry.

## Documentation
- `User docs`: end-user guidance, flow walkthroughs, and how-tos.
- `Developer docs`: integration guides, coding patterns, plugin creation notes, and contribution workflows.
- `About`: overview of the platform mission, principles, team, and governance.
- `API`: contract definitions, authentication, response codes, and error handling conventions.

## Source
### Plugins
- `ActionEntity`: entity lifecycle helpers and synchronization adapters.
- `ActionView`: rendering adapters, view utilities, and reactive plumbing.
- `ActionEvent`: domain event definitions, dispatchers, and enrichment helpers.
- `ActionServer`: server-side middleware, routing helpers, and request orchestration.
- `ActionClient`: client synchronization, websockets, and polling strategies.
- `ActionEngine Flow`: workflow definitions, orchestrated steps, state machine transitions, and diagnostics.

### Utility
- `ActionValidator`: centralized validation rules and schema enforcement helpers.
- `ActionInclude`: shared includes leveraged by other actions.
- `Parser`: document, payload, or script parsing utilities.
- `Include`: generic include helpers for templates, stories, or code generation.
- `ActionTree`: tree walkers for batch operations, reports, or hierarchical transforms.
- `ActionFs`: filesystem helpers for asset management, caching layers, or migration tooling.
- `ActionIndexDb`: indexedDB helpers for client persistence strategies.
- `ActionLocalStorage`: localStorage bindings, cache eviction strategies, and persistence helpers.
- `HttpService`: HTTP client wrappers with retry, timeout, and circuit metadata.
- `ActionAgent`: worker/agent orchestration utilities, message routing, and health checks.
- `Mat`: matrix, analytics, or math helpers powering simulation flows.
- `ActionOllama`: Ollama integrations, model connectors, and inference helpers.
- `Watchman`: file, process, or artifact monitoring helpers for CI/DI workflows.

## Tests
- `unitTestCases`: granular validation for actions, utilities, and configuration handlers.
- `e2eTestCases`: scenario-driven suites that surface cross-module behavior and plugin interactions.

## Reports
- `operationalMetrics`: runtime health dashboards, task duration, and error summaries.
- `auditReports`: compliance, change history, and event evaluations mapped to business rules.
- `pluginAnalysis`: plugin usage patterns, latency reports, and dependency diagrams.

## Logs
- `applicationLogs`: runtime telemetry, request traces, and status updates.
- `pluginLogs`: instrumented plugin events, lifecycle transitions, and error stack traces.
- `releaseLogs`: change notes, deployment timestamps, and rollout observations.

## Instructions
- `runbooks`: deployment, rollback, and maintenance instructions for on-call or release teams.
- `setupGuides`: local dev setup, configuration seeds, and dependency notes.
- `pluginOnboarding`: how-to for integrating new plugins, required metadata, and testing steps.

## Credentials
- `apiKeys`: lists of vault paths or placeholders for third-party keys, secrets, and scopes.
- `certificates`: signing cert information, expiry dates, and rotation reminders.
- `tokens`: scoped tokens, refresh guidance, and storage hints.

## Use Cases
- `erms`: enterprise resource management flows and reconciliation.
- `TMS`: transportation management sequences and scheduling.
- `ActionSpace`: workspace orchestration, layout, and collaboration flows.
- `ActionAgent`: runtime agent coordination, alerting, and orchestration.
- `Mat`: analytical use cases, simulation tooling, and metric exports.
- `Spa`: single-page application workflows and client hydration.
- `NodejsApi`: REST/GraphQL backends built with Node.js services.
- `SpreadSheet Server`: spreadsheet-driven backends or data transformation services.
