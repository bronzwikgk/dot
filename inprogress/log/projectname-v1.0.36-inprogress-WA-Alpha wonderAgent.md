User message: add search/query

## Summary
- Added a new `Search / Query` node to `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` containing `search` and `query` actions so the ver 1 index explicitly documents these operations.

## Jobs Queue
1. Ensure any tooling referencing the index handles the new Search / Query section.
2. Continue evolving the manifest when other capabilities are defined.
3. Log the next change when it happens.

## Status
- Manifest-only update; no tests were run.
