User message: Add a node with list of action and list of entity in version 1 and a node with list of all method

## Summary
- Enhanced `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` by adding dedicated `Actions`, `Entities`, and `Methods` nodes so ver 1 now explicitly catalogs the operable actions, available entity types, and the key ActionApp methods.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify tooling/parsers consume the new nodes without disruption.
2. Continue building manifest/fragments reflecting the approved ver 1 structure.
3. Log further updates when additional structure or tests are added.

## Status
- Manifest documentation update only; no tests were run.
