User message: add method name as child to class name inside class node

## Summary
- Added method child entries under the `Classes (ver 1)` node in `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, ensuring `ActionApp` and `ActionEntity` list their approved methods directly beneath their class names while the other classes remain listed for future expansion.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm the class node expansion doesn’t break any parsers or docs that consume this manifest.
2. Continue adding richer class/method descriptions as requested.
3. Log any further structural adjustments once they occur.

## Status
- Manifest update only; no tests were executed.
