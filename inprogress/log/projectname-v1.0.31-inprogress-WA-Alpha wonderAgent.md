User message: everythign shoudl be config based request and response based

## Summary
- Added `projectname-ActionApp-js-v1.0.31-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` to emphasize that every method, especially request/response flows, follows AppConfig-defined routes, auth, and formatting rules while maintaining the earlier method breakdown.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm tooling respects the new Request/Response contract documentation when building pipelines.
2. Continue adjusting fragments/manifests with config-first language if needed.
3. Record the next significant update after validation.

## Status
- Documentation update only; no automated tests were run.
