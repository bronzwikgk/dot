Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.13
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Added `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.13-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` where the Core folder now sits before plugins under `src`, and every method entry includes a sentence-style role description as requested.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify parser tooling handles the rearranged core/plugins order and the enriched role text.
2. Move forward with splitting code files aligned with this manifest.
3. Add follow-up documentation once the next extraction is complete.

## Status
- Manifest metadata updates; no code changes this round.
