project: erms
version: v1.1.24
status: completed
agent: KW-wonderAgent
summary:
  - reworked `shunya/index/erms-manifest-index-v1.1.24-active-KW-wonderAgent.yml` so only the header comments remain, with all metadata prefixed by `#` and the `root:` placeholder preserved, eliminating duplicate metadata blocks.
  - confirmed the file now carries metadata only inside the comment block while keeping the same naming/versioning requirements.
