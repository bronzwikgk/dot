User message: create a new version remove the child whose fragment has been create and have only path

## Summary
- Created `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.19-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` where each file-level node keeps only its path metadata (child method entries were removed because their fragments already exist), aligning the manifest with the latest fragment generation.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm the trimmed manifest can still drive tooling against the fragment files created earlier.
2. Continue refining source structure guided by the fragments and the path-only master index.
3. Capture any further structural decisions or tests in the next versioned document.

## Status
- Manifest-only update; no tests performed.
