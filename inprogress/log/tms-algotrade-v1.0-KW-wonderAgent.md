project: tms
version: v1.0
status: completed
agent: KW-wonderAgent
summary:
  - rebuilt `shunya/tms/Algotrade.html` as a semantic, light-theme, tabbed console with only semantic tags, attribute-based status cues, and no class-based CSS while keeping the same sections (strategy, backtest, paper/live trading, monitor, logs).
  - added a small script to switch tabs via buttons and refreshed the layout with light backgrounds, clean cards, and attribute selectors, plus ensured the nav stays in a single horizontal row with overflow scrolling on narrow screens.
