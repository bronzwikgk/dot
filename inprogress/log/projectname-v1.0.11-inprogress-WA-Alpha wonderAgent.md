Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.11
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Added `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.11-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, updating the plugin `role` attributes to full sentences that explain each class's responsibility in plain English while keeping the rest of the manifest syntax intact.

## Jobs Queue
1. Double-check parser/util expectations against the sentence-based roles and update helpers if needed.
2. Continue splitting the source per the enumerated files once the manifest is stable.
3. Draft a text artifact summarizing the split plan plus any new routes/tests.

## Status
- Documentation/manifest tuning; no code changes this turn.
