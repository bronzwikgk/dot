# ehh Manifest Update
Version: 1.0.1
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Added `_v1.0.1_` manifest that mirrors the `ehh_v1` layout but now includes file extensions for each plugin/utility entry so it’s clear which source files to create.
- Maintained the overall structure (assets, config, core, docs, src, tests, reports, logs, instructions, credentials, demo, use cases) while labeling each plugin/utility script with `.js`.

## Next Steps
- Use this versioned tree to guide splitting the codebase into the listed files, ensuring each plugin/utility is implemented as a `.js` module.
