Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.15
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Added `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.15-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, enriching every node with `path="…"`, keeping the role sentences, and maintaining index-based syntax.
- Generated per-code-file fragments under `shunya/ehh/fragments_ehh_index/` (each following the projectname+ver+status naming) so every JavaScript entry now lives in its own fragment file.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify any parser/cross-reference tooling recognizes the new path attributes plus fragment files.
2. Continue splitting source/setup per manifest guidance once tooling is stable.
3. Draft the next versioned doc after any significant file split or helper addition.

## Status
- Document/manifest updates only; no runtime edits.
