# Work Log
- Request: implement httpService in src/utils and test it
- Action: added `shunya/src/utils/httpService.js` with fetch/post/put/delete helpers and introduced `inprogress/test/httpService-v1.0.0.test.mjs` to mock fetch and log results.
- Result: Test run writes `inprogress/test/httpService-v1.0.0.test.log`, proving the HTTP helper is exercised.
