## Summary
- Created `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.14-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, documenting ActionApp with method-level breakdowns, semantic role descriptions, and a narrative role sentence about runtime detection, config loading, and plugin orchestration while keeping Core above plugins.

## Jobs Queue
1. Ensure parsers and downstream tooling understand the new ActionApp breakdown and role sentences.
2. Continue splitting source files aligned with the manifest taxonomy.
3. Draft the next versioned text artifact summarizing the next set of code migrations.

## Status
- Manifest and metadata only; no code changes were made during this step.
