# EHH V1 Source Label
Version: 1.0.0
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Renamed `shunya/ehh/ehh_v1.txt` to `shunya/ehh/ehh_v1.md` so that the manifest describing assets/configs/core/src/plugins/utilities/tests/reports/logs demonstrates correct extension naming, as requested.
- Recorded the versioned update so future iterations can reference this metadata when splitting the source into the structure outlined within the file.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring the source into the named directories (assets, configs, src plugins/utilities) while keeping this manifest at `ehh_v1.md` for quick reference.
