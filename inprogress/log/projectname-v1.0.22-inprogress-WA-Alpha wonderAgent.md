## Summary
- Removed every `*-v1.0.18-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` file from `shunya/ehh/fragments_ehh_index/` so only the latest `v1.0.19` fragments remain, matching your request for a single current set.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm the trimmed workspace still satisfies any tooling expectations now that only v1.0.19 fragments exist.
2. Continue working through the manifest/fragment-driven splits described previously.
3. Document the next structural change when appropriate.

## Status
- Fragment cleanup only; no tests were run.
