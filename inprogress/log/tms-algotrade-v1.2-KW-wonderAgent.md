version: v1.2
status: completed

summary:
  - replaced `shunya/tms/Algotrade.html` with `v1.2`, a minimal-light layout that uses global token styling, rem-based spacing, and semantic tags for Dashboard, Portfolio, Screener, Tradebook, Live Positions, and Settings tabs plus an aside featuring alerts, search, explorer, and a live token list sourced from `dataset__pari_global_tokens_v1.js`.
  - ensured all CSS references global tokens, removed px units, added the token tag cloud, and kept the tab navigation single-row while importing the dataset file for runtime tag generation.
