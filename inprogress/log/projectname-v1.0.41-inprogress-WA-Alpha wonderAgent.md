User message: mergeActionTree and actionEntity class into one actionEntity and add method related to all the operation on a tree based data or an tree editor application

## Summary
- Merged the `actionTree` class into the `ActionEntity` entry inside `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, expanding its method list with tree builder/traversal helpers (`buildTree`, `traverse`, `flatten`) so the merged class now documents all tree operations you asked for.

## Jobs Queue
1. Ensure this merged representation stays consumable by your parser/docs.
2. Keep extending or refining class/method nodes as new requirements appear.
3. Log further changes in another versioned note.

## Status
- Documentation update only; no automated tests were run.
