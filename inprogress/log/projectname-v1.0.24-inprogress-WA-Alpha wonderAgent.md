## Summary
- Enriched `shunya/ehh/fragments_ehh_index/projectname-ActionApp-js-v1.0.19-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` with the requested features list and dependency notes for `ActionApp.js`, tagging each bullet as documentation-type entries so the metadata captures your description.

## Jobs Queue
1. Maintain consistency between the fragment features list and the manifest when future ActionApp edits happen.
2. Keep applying parser/fragment-driven splits once these documentation captions are validated.
3. Log subsequent structural or code changes as separate versioned entries.

## Status
- Fragment documentation update only; no runtime tests were executed.
