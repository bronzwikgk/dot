User message: seems v 19  of gramets has issue, move content from v18 i v 19 

## Summary
- Copied every `v1.0.18` fragment into the matching `v1.0.19` files inside `shunya/ehh/fragments_ehh_index/` so the v19 fragments now contain the v18 method-level content again, aligning with the manifest’s trimmed nodes.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify the fragment set now matches expectations before any future manifest trimming.
2. Continue progressing the config/manifest splitting work guided by the latest fragments and logs.
3. Document the next structural milestone in a future versioned log entry when ready.

## Status
- Fragment refresh only; no tests executed this round.
