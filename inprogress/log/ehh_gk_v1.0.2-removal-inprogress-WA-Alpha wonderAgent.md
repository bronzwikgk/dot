# Work Log
- Request: remove the RequestConfig/ResponseConfig/AppConfig classes from the latest version.
- Action: deleted `shunya/ehh/ehh_gk_v1.0.2-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.js` and its changelog so the prior versions remain as references.
- Result: No class definitions remain in the newest file; refer to earlier versions for structured configs instead.
