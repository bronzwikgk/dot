status: completed
agent: KW-wonderAgent
summary:
  - created skill packages for architect, engineer, designer, coder, generator, evaluator, planner, recommender, parser, test-case writer, test orchestrator, and debugger so the agent roster handles EHh documentation, coding, and testing roles.
  - documented each skill with triggers, role guidance, and outputs to support future requests that mention those personas.
