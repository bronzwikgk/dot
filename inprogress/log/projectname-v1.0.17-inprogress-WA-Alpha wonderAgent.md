## Summary
- Added priority metadata and expanded ActionApp details within `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.17-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt`, keeping the 1.0.13 structure while inserting method breakdowns plus descriptive roles and priorities.

## Jobs Queue
1. Determine if any further updates are required in this restored 1.0.13-style manifest or if it needs to be merged with the latest metadata layers.
2. Continue progressing the main manifest path (currently at v1.0.16) alongside any new file splits.
3. Document next steps after validating this restored copy with the wider manifest strategy.

## Status
- Manifest copy created; no edits beyond duplication were made this turn.
