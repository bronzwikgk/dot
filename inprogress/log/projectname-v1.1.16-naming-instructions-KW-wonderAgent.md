project: projectname
version: v1.1.16
status: note
agent: KW-wonderAgent
summary:
  - documented the naming convention requirement that every generated file must embed the semantic version, status, and agent alias in its filename (e.g., `projectname-v1.1.16-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.yml`).
  - clarified that maintaining semantic versioning means creating a new file for each version/status update rather than overwriting previous files, preserving traceability.
  - noted that this rule applies across indexes, datasets, renderer outputs, and log entries.
