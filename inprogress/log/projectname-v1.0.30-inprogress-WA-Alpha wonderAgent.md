## Summary
- Added `projectname-ActionApp-js-v1.0.30-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` describing each ActionApp method flow in plain language and appended a small list of test cases that verify the critical runtime behaviors.

## Jobs Queue
1. Validate that the new fragment layout parses cleanly in any automation that consumes fragments.
2. Continue applying this flow/test style if it proves valuable for other modules.
3. Log further work when new fragments, manifests, or data updates land.

## Status
- Documentation-only update; no runtime tests were executed.
