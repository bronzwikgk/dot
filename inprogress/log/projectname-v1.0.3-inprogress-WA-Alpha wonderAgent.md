Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.3
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Updated `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.txt` so every plugin/utility method lives on its own line per the manifest's enumeration.
- Ensured job log demand satisfied with this new entry and noted current focus on tree/document consistency.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm the parsed method listings continue to match the actual src files, using the parser utility to double-check.
2. Keep executing the plan laid out in v1.0.2 log: splitting shared functionality across files tied to the manifest.
3. Draft the next versioned textual document that captures the updated tree structure and any new helper utilities.

## Status
- Currently adjusting the manifest tree; next priority is parser verification before touching source splits.
