User message: remove ActionFramework, - actionAgent
    - Mat
    - ActionOllama
    - Watchman
    - ActionGit,

## Summary
- Pruned `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` so the ver‑1 class list no longer mentions `ActionFramework`, `actionAgent`, `Mat`, `ActionOllama`, `Watchman`, or `ActionGit`, keeping only the operational classes you still want documented.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm downstream tooling matches this trimmed class list.
2. Keep evolving manifests/fragments as the proect progresses.
3. Log further updates once the next major change lands.

## Status
- Documentation-only update; no tests executed.
