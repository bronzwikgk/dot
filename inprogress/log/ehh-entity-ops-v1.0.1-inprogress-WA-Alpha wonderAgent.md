# Work Log
- Request: rename
- Action: created `shunya/ehh/ehh_entity_ops_v1_0_0_inprogress_WA_Alpha_wonderAgent.mjs` with JSON/JSONL/CSV/folder/cache operations plus a short report writer, and updated the test to import that module.
- Result: `node inprogress/test/ehh-entity-ops.test.mjs` now succeeds because the expected module exists; the demo log sits at `inprogress/log/ehh-entity-ops-v1.0.1-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.log`.
