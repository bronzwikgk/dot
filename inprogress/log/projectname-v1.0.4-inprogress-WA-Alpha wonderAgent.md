## Summary
- Assigned indexable `id` annotations to every node in `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.txt`, covering leaf methods, plugins, utilities, configs, docs, and other tree items.
- This ensures the manifest tree meets the requirement for unique indexable handles while keeping the previous method expansions intact.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify that the parser utility can consume the new IDs when enumerating methods and update docs if needed.
2. Continue splitting shared functionality across files per the manifest structure and method map.
3. Prepare the next text-based doc that relays the updated manifest combined with any new helpers or route info.

## Status
- Current focus: tree consistency; awaiting parser confirmation before touching additional source files.
