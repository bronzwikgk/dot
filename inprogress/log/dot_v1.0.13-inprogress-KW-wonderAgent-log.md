# Change Log
version: v1.0.13
status: inprogress
agent: KW-wonderAgent

## Activities
- Added the native browser tester `dot-actionBrowserNativeTest-v1.0.0-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.html` that exercises IndexedDB/localStorage via their native APIs, logs every step to both DOM and console, cleans up the temporary database, and allows manual verification without the helper utilities.

## Tests
- Manual browser execution only; open the HTML page, click the buttons, and observe the console plus the result list for each operation since automation is unavailable.

## User Input
- create a test file without these utilt to test without them currently they ar not working
