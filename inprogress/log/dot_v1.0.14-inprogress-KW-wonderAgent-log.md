# Change Log
version: v1.0.14
status: inprogress
agent: KW-wonderAgent

## Activities
- Created `dot-actionLocalStorageTest-v1.0.0-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.html`, a single-button page that runs the same LocalStorage operations without importing any utilities, logs every action to the DOM, and prints the same step in the console (writes, reads, updates, delete, and key enumeration) while deliberately leaving storage untouched after the test.

## Tests
- Manual browser run only; open the new HTML page, click “Test LocalStorage Operations,” and watch the log list plus DevTools console for each step.

## User Input
- whyis it not working, recreate a html page, that has a button test local storage when I click it it add mutliple record in local stoage and perform differant operation while showing each ioeraiton in deom with input and output along with console. Only local storage do not use any external code
