User message: recreate actionApp framegment agaisn fromt scratch follwing all strcure rules but removeing old method and using new data

## Summary
- Rebuilt `projectname-ActionApp-js-v1.0.19-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` from scratch so it strictly follows the structural rules (type/priority/path) while now describing only the updated feature list and dependency notes, omitting the previous method section as requested.

## Jobs Queue
1. Validate the new fragment structure matches whatever parser consumes these documentation blocks.
2. Continue evolving the manifest/fragments as the code splits progress and log each meaningful update.
3. Capture future structural changes in the next versioned log entry.

## Status
- Documentation-only update; no tests were run.
