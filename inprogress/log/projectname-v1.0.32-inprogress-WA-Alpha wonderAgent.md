## Summary
- Updated `shunya/ehh/ehh_v1.0.1-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` to include the approved class list for ver 1 (omitting MemoryStorage) while leaving every other class/method block untouched.
- Added a new manifest `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` that covers ver 1 CRUD over JSON/JSONL for Node plus browser runtimes and lists the approved classes/workflows/tests.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify any tooling referencing the class list now uses the updated approved section without MemoryStorage.
2. Continue with fragment/manifest updates once this ver 1 index is validated.
3. Log future structural changes in a new versioned entry.

## Status
- Manifest documentation only; no runtime tests were executed.
