User message: need all the methods from all the classes n the method list, action is single worded verb, add Portoflio, Project, Session as entity

## Summary
- Updated `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` to list only single-word verbs under Actions, expand Methods with every class-level routine (rendering, events, storage, utilities), and add Portfolio/Project/Session to the Entities node so ver 1 now enumerates the requested APIs and methods.

## Jobs Queue
1. Ensure tooling reading the index tolerates the long Methods list and simple-action verbs.
2. Continue documenting subsequent structural steps as needed.
3. Run whatever verification suites are appropriate after these manifest shifts.

## Status
- Documentation/manifest update only; no tests were run.
