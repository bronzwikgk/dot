User message: add methods

## Summary
- Added method listings under each of the custom utility nodes (`actionFS.js`, `actionInclude_v1.0.js`, `ehh-renderDoc.mjs`, `index_tree_parser_v1.7.0_active_Codex.js`, `parser_v1.js`) in `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` so the new utilities now explicitly describe their supported operations.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm the new method descriptions integrate with any parser or docs tool that consumes the index.
2. Continue making structured updates to manifests/fragments per your instructions.
3. Log future updates as needed.

## Status
- Documentation update only; no tests were executed.
