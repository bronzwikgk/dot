status: completed
agent: KW-wonderAgent
summary:
  - created `shunya/index/ehh-manifest-index.yml` as the authoritative EHh manifest index stored in the approved `.yml` format.
  - documented project meta, manifest sections, technical design references, dataset catalog, workflow, and directory tree that align with the original ERMS template style.
  - ensured the manifest points to dataset files and renderer outputs without touching existing user indexes, while following the `.yml` requirement for operational indexes.
