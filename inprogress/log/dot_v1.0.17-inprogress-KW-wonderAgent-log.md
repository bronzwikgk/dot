## Tests
- Manual browser execution only; open the HTML page and click “Test LocalStorage Operations” to observe the extended log and verify the actual LocalStorage entries persisted for inspection.

## User Input
- need 20 records and more than 30 tarnsaction in locatorage with differant tyrpe of data
