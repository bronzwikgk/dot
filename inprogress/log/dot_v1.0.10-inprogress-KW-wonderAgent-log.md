# Change Log
version: v1.0.10
status: inprogress
agent: KW-wonderAgent

## Activities
- Added the browser-facing HTML tester `dot-actionBrowserTest-v1.0.0-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.html` that imports the approved IndexedDB and LocalStorage utilities, runs the flows via an orchestrator class, and exposes result buttons plus method lists.
- Documented the dataset lists on the page itself so manual testers can see which helpers are covered without reading source.

## Tests
- Browser automation unavailable in this environment; load the new HTML test page in a browser to manually confirm the flows.

## User Input
- create a html flie to test indexdb and local storage
