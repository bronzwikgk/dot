# Work Log
- Request: each class/method should explicitly display readiness status
- Action: added `[status=ready]` to every class/method in `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.59-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` so the manifest shows its current state.
- Result: The manifest now reports statuses for all classes/methods, matching the document-level ready/ongoing signals.
