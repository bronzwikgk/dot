summary:
  - refactored `shunya/tms/Algotrade.html` into a minimal-light console with semantic tabs that now include Dashboard, Portfolio, Screener, Tradebook, Live Positions, and Settings, aligning the workflow with your requested layout.
  - added an `aside` for recent alerts, search, and explorer tools while simplifying the color palette, keeping the nav row single-line, and retaining the attribute-driven tab logic.
