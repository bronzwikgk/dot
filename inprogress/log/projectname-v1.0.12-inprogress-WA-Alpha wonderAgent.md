Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.12
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Staged `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.12-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` so method entries now include plain-English role sentences, and moved the Core folder underneath `src` as requested while keeping the rest of the manifest syntax intact.

## Jobs Queue
1. Confirm tooling/parsers parse the sentence-style roles and new core placement correctly.
2. Proceed with splitting code according to the manifest’s current map.
3. Capture the next versioned doc summarizing any newly extracted files or helpers.

## Status
- Focused on manifest/metadata updates; no runtime changes introduced in this turn.
