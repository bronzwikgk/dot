Changes:
- Published manifest v1.0.57 describing the new ERM entity configs and the fact that backend now registers routes for every catalog entry so diagnostics cover all entities.
- Linked the dataset-driven validation source and highlighted the additional automation matrix for those entries.

User request: I want all those entity config in our system so that we can test them in backend routes
