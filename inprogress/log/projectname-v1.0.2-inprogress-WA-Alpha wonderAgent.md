Project: projectname
Version: 1.0.2
Status: inprogress
Agent: WA-Alpha wonderAgent

## Summary
- Reviewed current manifest and frontend assets after previous agent summary.
- Identified need for further split of src/* into dedicated files per method listing and config extraction for upcoming iterations.

## Jobs Queue
1. Solidify file splitting plan referenced in `shunya/ehh/ehh_v1.0.1-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` and identify classes/plugins to extract next.
2. Map parser utility usage to automate method enumeration and confirm manifest reflects actual code locations.
3. Prepare next doc update (text file) summarizing new structure and test strategy, keeping naming/version rules.

## Status
- Current status: assessing split requirements and planning follow-up work before editing code files.
