# Change Log
version: v1.0.8
status: inprogress
agent: KW-wonderAgent

## Activities
- Confirmed that the approved `dot-actionFs-v1.0.5` utility is the canonical implementation and noted that plugin consumers should use the shim.
- Executed `node inprogress/test/dot-actionFS-test-v1.0.5-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.js`; the script reported creation of workspace artifacts and verified every helper before cleaning up.
- Captured the latest status in the jobs queue (`inprogress/jobs-queue-dot-v1.0.8-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.md`) to track remaining ActionFs tasks.

## Tests
- `dot-actionFS-test-v1.0.5-inprogress-KW-wonderAgent.js`: passed (logs cite creation of configs/files followed by cleanup, ending with success message).
