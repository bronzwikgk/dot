User message: clean up method list, add only actionApp method

## Summary
- Simplified the `Methods` section in `shunya/ehh/ehh_index_v1.0.32-inprogress-WA-Alpha wonderAgent.txt` so it now lists only the ActionApp-level methods (constructor, lifecycle/event/CRUD helpers, and HTTP server starter) while preserving the other nodes like Actions and Entities.

## Jobs Queue
1. Verify the trimmed method list still aligns with any tooling expecting ActionApp entries.
2. Continue evolving the manifest as more ver 1 features arrive.
3. Log future updates in new versioned files.

## Status
- Documentation update only; no tests executed.
