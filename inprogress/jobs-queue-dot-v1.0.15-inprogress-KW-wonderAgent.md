1. Deliver a browser HTML page that imports the approved LocalStorage/IndexedDB utilities and visually logs each helper invocation (inputs and outputs) so the team can test the utility modules inside a browser.
2. Ensure the controls separate LocalStorage, IndexedDB, and combined runs, and that the activity log mirrors console output.
3. Provide manual validation instructions in the page and reflect the new artifact in the changelog/log entry.
